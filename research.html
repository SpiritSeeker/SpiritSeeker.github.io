                    My Ph.D. topic is a study on the design and analysis of algorithms for energy-efficient machine learning, under <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/EC/faculty/ec-bsahoo" target="_blank">Prof. Bibhudatta Sahoo</a> at <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/">IIT Kharagpur</a>. My current focus is on the following target problems:
                    <ul>
                        <li class="content"><span class="topic-title">Image Classification:</span>
                            The goal is to develop energy-efficient systems for Internet-of-Things (IoT) edge devices that have low power consumption and small memory requirements. To achieve this, the research focuses on algorithmic optimizations, including techniques like weight quantization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to powers-of-2 or the use of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).
                        </li>

                        <li class="content"><span class="topic-title">Seizure Prediction:</span>
                            In many practical scenarios, neural networks are used as part of a bigger system. For example, a CNN may be used to detect a seizure from the frequency features an EEG signal. In such cases, the energy consumption of both the feature extraction block and the classifier is of interest. To goal is to develop a low-power system that can be used in a wearable device for seizure prediction.
                        </li>

                        <li class="content"><span class="topic-title">ADC Calibration:</span>
                            Neural Networks can be used for calibrating ADCs. These networks are trained on-chip to generate optimal outputs. This system should run at very high speeds and train with low bit-precision.

                    My M.Tech. thesis is titled "SpikeSim: A Modular Neuronal Network Simulator", under <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/EC/faculty/ec-aniket" target="_blank">Prof. Aniket Singha</a> at <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Kharagpur</a>. The goal was to develop a simulator for
                    simulating neuronal networks with various devices modeling the neurons and synapses. The simulator was developed in C++
